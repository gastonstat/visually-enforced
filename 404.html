<h2>404, Ooops!</h2>

For some unknown/awkward/pathetic reasons the page you are looking for does not exist.


<div id="posts" style="margin-top: 20px;">

    However, you might be interested in these recent posts:

    <br />

    {% for post in site.posts offset: 0 limit: 5 %}

        <small>
            <a href="{{ post.url}}">{{ post.title }}</a>
        </small>
        <br />

    {% endfor %}

</div>
