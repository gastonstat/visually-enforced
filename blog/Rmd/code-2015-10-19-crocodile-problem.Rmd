Using R to solve the [crocodile math problem]() from the Scottish __Higher Maths__ exam of May 2015.

### Motivation

Reading the Spanish newspaper [La Vanguardia](http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20151019/54437267761/enigma-cocodrilo-cebra-estudiantes-escoceses.html), I found a curious article about a math problem that S4 Scottish students (the equivalent to high school's senior year) struggled with last May on their [SQA Higher Maths test](http://www.sqa.org.uk/pastpapers/papers/papers/2015/NH_Mathematics_all_2015.pdf).

Here's the problem.

### Getting Started

The first thing to do is write a function containing the formula of \\( T(x) \\) the time taken for the crocodile to reach its prey:

```{r 'crocfunction'}
# time taken function
croctime <- function(x) 5 * sqrt(36 + x^2) + 4 * (20 - x)
```

Now let's look at this function. I'll choose an interval of (0, 20) for (\\ x \\) since this represents the distance (0 meters, 20 meters).
```{r 'croctime', fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
curve(croctime, 0, 20, las = 1, lwd = 5, col = "#68A959",
      xlab = "distance", ylab = "time")
```


### First question 

_Calculate the time taken if the crocodile does not travel on land._ That means that the crocodile swims the entire 20 meters.
```{r}
croctime(20)
```

### Second question

_Calculate the time taken if the crocodile swims the shortest distance possible._ Personally I think that this question is poorly written and/or bad designed. What does the "shortest distance possible" mean? Assuming that the shortest distance possible is 0 meters, then the time taken to swim 0 meters is:
```{r}
croctime(0)
```


### Third question

_Between these two extremes there is one value of (\\ x \\) which minimizes the time taken. Find this value of (\\ x \\) and hence calculate the minimum possible time._  This is a typical calculus problem of minimizing a function. In this case the function to be minimized is the time taken. This implies calculating the derivative of (\\ T(x) \\).

We can use the function `deriv()` to compute the derivative of a simple expression (symbolically). 
```{r 'derivative'}
# derivative of T(x)
deriv(y ~ 5 * sqrt(36 + x^2) + 4*(20 - x), "x")
```

As you can tell from the output of `deriv()`, the fifth line contains the desired derivative:
`.grad[, "x"] <- 5 * (0.5 * (2 * x * .expr2^-0.5)) - 4`

We can also obtain this derivative by using the function `D()` and pass it the body of the function `croctime()` like so:
```{r}
g <- function(x) {}
body(g) <- D(body(croctime), 'x')

body(g)
```

Looking at the graphic of time, the curve has a minimum somewhere between 7 meters and 10 meters. We can evaluate the derivative `g()` with some `x` values to try to narrow down our search for the minimum value. 
```{r}
# distance values
seq(7, 10, length.out = 10)

# evaluating derivative
g(seq(7, 10, length.out = 10))
```

Aha! the minimum value is at a distance of 8 meters! To confirm that 8 is actually the root of the polynomial, we can use the function `multiroot()` from the package `"rootSolve"` by [Karline Soetaert](https://www.nioz.nl/staff-detail?id=784400)

```{r}
library(rootSolve)

multiroot(g, c(7, 10))
```

There you go: the minimum taken time for the crocodile to catch the zebra is given when the crocodile swims 8 meters, and then walks the other 12 meters.
