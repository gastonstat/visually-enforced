Recently, I was chatting with one of my friends about the stuff I do as an applied 
statistician. What could have been a boring conversation turned out to be an interesting 
discussion about what people learn in college compared to what they face outside the classrooms.

As a side effect of that talk I decided to create this post about the differences 
between what we learn in school and textbooks, and what we learn in the real life.


### The idealized data analysis process

The impression you may get in your courses about a data analysis project is that of a 
straight forward process in which you just have to run some script and you will get a 
beautiful result.

(I really wished all my projects were like this... but that only happens in my dreams)


### The real data analysis process

Real data analysis processes look a lot whole different. If you're planning on making 
your living as a data analyst, it's only a matter of time before you hit the wall. 
Eventually, you will realize that most of your teachers gave you a very biased view of 
how the data analysis world works. My cartoon version goes more or less like this:

As most of my colleagues, I learned my lessons the hard way. I wished my professors 
had talked to me about all the dirtinessÂ involved with data collection, data processing, 
data cleaning, data formatting, data reshaping, as well as the overvalued expectations 
when applying fancy models and making predictions. Perhaps that would have prevented me 
some early frustations in my first projects. Anyway, I love my profession and I'm 
constantly looking on the bright side of my analyses while having fun at the same time.
