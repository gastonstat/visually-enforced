This is probably one of my shortest posts, but this doesn't mean that it is useless.

Long time ago I stumbled upon a very interesting resource: an [R cheat sheet for graphical parameters](https://flowingdata.com/2015/03/17/r-cheat-sheet-for-graphical-parameters/) available at Nathan Yau's __Flowing Data__ website. Although this is an amazing nugget for any useR interested in plots and graphics in R, it has one little caveat: to get access to it you must be a member of Flowing Data (by the way: I'm not a member, but I do have both of Yau's excellent books).

> Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery

For one of the courses I'm teaching, I've decided to imitate and produce a modified version of the graphical parameters cheat sheet which you can find [here](/teaching/stat133/r-graphical-parameters-cheatsheet.pdf).

Enjoy and happy plotting!
