In September of last year I started to prepare some teaching material about Partial Least Squares methods. And of course I also thought about including a couple of sections about the history and evolution of such techniques.

This wasn't the first time I was writing about the story behind PLS. I had previously written a chapter on this subject for my PhD Dissertation, and I had also included an appendix in my book __PLS Path Modeling with R__. However, this time I wanted to write something a little bit different. I knew I didn't want to list again the same material I had published before. But I wasn't quite sure about what to do this time.

Fortunately, it didn't take me long to come up with some ideas. At the end, I decided to write the content in a narrative style (i.e. my weird attempt to imitate a historic novel writing format). And so I pushed myself to be the narrator of the long series of events that have shaped the path traveled by PLS methods.

What I didn't have in mind was to come up with a separate publication for the historical content. My original plan---until very recently---was to put that content next to the technical stuff (theory, equations, algebra, examples, case studies, etc).

About three weeks ago I had one of those _Eureka_ moments of inspiration. I guess some synapsis fired in my neurons that made me change plans. "What if I split the historical content and put it in a separate manuscript?" On the one hand, that part of the material was almost finished. On the other hand, I could experiment with creating a book entirely readable online (which is something I had been wanting to do for a long time).

I can't say much right now, but I can definitely tell you that I'm very excited for this new project. Coming really soon ... _a saga of PLS_.
