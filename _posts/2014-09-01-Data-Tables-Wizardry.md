In this post I'm sharing the slides of a workshop I had the pleasure to give this summer: 
**Manipulating Data Tables with R**. Hopefully, this material will give you a jump-start
to improve your *data wizardry* skills.

## Data Summer

This summer has been one of the busiest summers I've ever had. Among many other projects 
and commitments, I had the pleasure to give a workshop about Manipulating Data Tables with R.

It's hard to know in advance whether people will be engaged when giving a talk, or a course 
&mdash;specially when the participants form a unique audience coming from different 
fields and with very heterogenous backgrounds. However, I was amazed to see the great 
enthusiasm and involvement showed by all the participants. At the end, I decided 
to talk to the workshop organizers about an issue that was left out of the contract: 
"Would you agree to let me release the slides and make them publicly available?"
I was very happy when they gladly accepted my proposal with no strings attached.

I'm also taking advantage of this period of the year when summer vacations are 
almost over and students are getting ready to go back to school. For those *padawans* 
pursuing a career with a heavy analytics component, I'm convinced that these slides 
will help them build some of the required skills to crunch data in R.

</ul>

As I always tell the audience during my trainings, tutorials and workshops:
there are 3 things you should do to become proficient when learning a new skill: 
1) practice, 2) practice, and 3) practice.
