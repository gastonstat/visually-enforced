## Introduction

A couple of days ago I was contacted by [Yan Holtz](https://holtzyan.wordpress.com), a French researcher involved in statistical programming and bioinformatics.

As you can tell from the screenshot above Yan is starting a new R graph gallery [www.r-graph-gallery.com](http://www.r-graph-gallery.com), and he wanted to know if I was interested in contributing with my random paintings in the _Data Art_ section of the gallery. And of course I couldn't say no.

Yesterday, Yan let me know that some of my plots are now displayed in the R graph gallery. Kudos to Yan for curating this fresh gallery, and cheers to the other R-tists contributing to this project (e.g. Marcus Volz, Alisa Singer, Nadieh Bremer, Paivi Julin)
