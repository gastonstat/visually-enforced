This week (June 7-10) I was able to fulfill a promise made long ago to my 
dearest friend and colleague Dr. Lucas Lopez Segovia: to visit the 
Division of <a href="http://www.ujat.mx/dacb" target="_blank">Ciencias Basicas</a> 
(DACB) at the Universidad Juarez Autonoma de Tabasco (UJAT).

Academically speaking, the purpose of this trip was two-fold: to give a 
workshop on dynamic documents with R (and related packages), and to be the 
guest speaker for the monthly seminar organized at the DACB.


### Context of my talk

> Open science is the movement to make scientific research, data and 
> dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur 
> or professional.

Here's a list with some recommendations to keep in mind if we really want 
the seed of Open Science to find fertile soil:

- First things first: you have to adopt it!
- Teach it to our students
- Make sharing and openning a habit
- Submit to Open Access journals
- Support publication in Open Access Journals
- Review for Open Access Journals 
- Request code and data when reviewing
- Give professors promotions based on open-shared work
- Support publication in Open Access Journals
- Ask for evidence when hiring
- Consider Open Science practices when hiring, referencing, and promotion
