## Beamer Themes

In a couple of previous posts I've talked about my repulsion to the the typical [beamer themes](https://www.hartwork.org/beamer-theme-matrix/) that so many people in academia 
use to create slides and presentations (see figure below).

There are several reasons why I don't like such themes: they tend to be very cluttered with
most of the secondary elements taking so much screen space; and their color palettes are 
not my favorite. 

Early this year I chose to create my first style which I applied to produce 
"Getting Data from the Web with R". My inspiration was 
[Karl Broman's](https://kbroman.wordpress.com/about/) helpful post:
[better-looking LaTeX/Beamer slides](https://kbroman.wordpress.com/2013/10/07/better-looking-latexbeamer-slides/).

A couple of readers asked me if I could share the source code that I used to produce the 
slides of [GWDR](/work/webdata). I know I haven't been very diligent in answering their 
petition... but finally I have found some free time to prepare the following sample files. 
Keep in mind that I use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) with ```"knitr"``` to make my slides.

- Beamer ```.sty``` file [here](/work/slides2gwdr.sty)
- R Noweb ```.Rnw``` file [here](/work/slides2gwdr.Rnw)
- Sample slides ```.pdf``` file [here](/work/slides2gwdr.pdf)

Hopefully next time (i.e. next year) I decide to write about my beamer style-guide, 
I will provide detailed descriptions for the different elements in my slides.
