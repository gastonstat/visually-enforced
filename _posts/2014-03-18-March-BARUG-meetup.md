Yesterday (Saint Patrick's Day) I attended the March 2014 Meetup of the **Bay Area useR Group** (BARUG), 
this time in San Francisco. We had the nice chance to hear three interesting talks that 
covered a variety of uses, applications, examples, and news from active useRs.

As usual, the meeting was nicely organized by [Joseph Rickert](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/joseph-rickert/0/a96/a45) 
(from Revolution Analytics), and this time it was hosted by Predictive Analytics World, 
who had its march session in San Francisco. By the way, I wish we had more meetings like 
this in SF, since most of the times they take place in the south bay and that makes the 
commuting harder for guys like me who are based in Alameda, Contra Costa, and northern counties.


### Meetup Agenda

I'll give you a quick description of last night's agenda with some personal impressions:

- *Predictive Models in R Clustered by Tag Similarity* by Max Kuhn
- *plyrmr: Hadoop Mapreduce for the rest of us* by Antonio Piccolboni
- *Statistics, R and Human Rights* by Megan Price

An interesting fact of this meetup was that it was first time that we had three repeating 
speakers. I'm not sure if this is good or bad, or maybe both. I believe there are plenty 
of speakers out there doing awesome things with R that would be nice to hear about in a BARUG 
meeting for the first time. But for those of us who cannot attend to all meetings, it's good 
to have a second chance to listen to speakers who have previously talked. Their continuous 
activity around R and their very interesting material makes it always worth being there.


### Predictive Models in R Clustered by Tag Similarity

[Max Kuhn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/max-kuhn/10/a91/864) was the first speaker of the 
night. He's the creator of the R package [caret](http://caret.r-forge.r-project.org/), 
and co-author of a recently published book [Applied Predictive Modeling](http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/).

Kuhn's talk was basically about how to make a [network diagram](http://caret.r-forge.r-project.org/similarity.html) 
of all the models that can be accessed by ```caret```'s train function. For those of you who 
haven't heard about ```caret```, this package provides a unified user interface to the wide 
range of machine learning models in R. 

In order to help users navigate through the ecosystem of machine learning and statistics 
models, Max has made a catalog by assigning tags to each model (e.g. tags related to 
model training, prediction, variable importance and so on). You can check 
[this post](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2014/01/predictive-models-in-r-clustered-by-tag-similarity-1.html) 
that contains more detailed information about the resulting network.


### plyrmr: Hadoop Mapreduce for the rest of us

The second speaker of the meetup was [Antonio Piccolboni](http://piccolboni.info/). He's 
one the lead developers behind the [RHadoop project](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RHadoop/wiki).

Antonio gave a presentation about the R package [plyrmr](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RHadoop/wiki/plyrmr). 
(short for plyr mapreduce). Broadly speaking, this package allows users to perform data 
manipulations as found in packages like ```plyr``` and ```reshape2```, on very large data sets stored 
on [Hadoop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop). The special feature about 
```plyrmr``` is that it relies on Hadoop mapreduce to 
perform its operations but it hides many of its related intricacies. At the end, what you 
have with ```plyrmr``` is a familiar plyr-like interface for non Hadoop users. To be 
honest, I haven't tried any of the RHadoop associated packages, but from Antonio's talk, 
now I'm more than curious to check them out and see how they can benefit me.


### Statistics, R and Human Rights

The third and last speaker of the meetup was [Megan Price](https://hrdag.org/meganprice/). 
She's the co-founder and director of research of [Human Rights Data Analysis Group](https://hrdag.org/) (HRDAG). 
Simply put HRDAG is a non-profit, non-partisan organization that applies rigorous science 
to the analysis of human rights violations around the world.

I loved the extremely interesting and captivating title of her talk 
*How a Small Non-Profit Human Rights Group Uses R* (see picture below).

Megan talked about the overall analysis pipeline at HRDAG and the role R plays within 
their workflow. Among the various reasons for choosing and using R over other programs, 
she highlighted the interoperability that R allows with other elements present in any data analysis 
project: data sets, reports, documentation. 

Generating reports and documents (with the help of Sweave and knitr) allows you to avoid 
error-prone copy-pastings, while keeping updated your workflow. Since much of the data at 
HRDAG gets constantly updated with new feeds from their partners, they need to be able 
re-run the analyses, plots, and summaries. R is great for this type of tasks.

Although Megan didn't talk about the applied models, nor she showed a case study, 
she showed us some really cool examples of the non-typical type of data they have to deal 
with and how they tackle seemingly unanswerable questions like: what is the number of 
victims in several war conflicts around the world.
