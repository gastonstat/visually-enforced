On November 29 (2013) I had the nice opportunity to visit my French colleagues at the 
<a href="http://math.agrocampus-ouest.fr/infoglueDeliverLive/" target="_blank">LMA2: Laboratoire de Mathématiques Appliquées</a> 
(Applied Mathematic Lab) in Agrocampus, Rennes.

The perfect excuse was 
<a href="http://sebastien.ledien.free.fr/" title="Sebastien Le" target="_blank">Sébastien Lê's</a> 
invitation to give a talk to the grad students specializing in applied statistics.

In case you are wondering who's part of the LMA or what they do? Well it happens that 
they are one of the most active French groups working with 
<a href="http://www.r-project.org/" title="R project" target="_blank">R</a>, and creators 
of some really cool packages for data analysis like 
<a href="http://factominer.free.fr/" title="factominer" target="_blank">FactoMineR</a>, 
<a href="http://sensominer.free.fr/" title="sensominer" target="_blank">SensoMineR</a>, 
<a href="http://math.agrocampus-ouest.fr/infoglueDeliverLive/developpement/missMDA" title="missMDA" target="_blank">missMDA</a>, 
and <a href="http://famt.free.fr/" title="FAMT" target="_blank">FAMT</a>.

This time I was kindly hosted by <a href="http://math.agrocampus-ouest.fr/infoglueDeliverLive/membres/julie.josse" title="Julie Josse" target="_blank">Julie Josse</a>, 
who is always enthusiastic to talk about her research and other topics related with data 
analysis. I also took advantage of my visit to keep the old book signing tradition and 
ask Jérôme Pagès to sign me a copy of his most recent book (in French) 
<a href="http://math.agrocampus-ouest.fr/infoglueDeliverLive/enseignement/support2cours/books/AFM" title="AFM in R" target="_blank">Analyse factorielle multiple avec R</a>.

### Context of my talk

Sébastien asked me to make a presentation for the grad students on the work that I've 
done. First I thought about presenting some case study or some specific statistical 
analysis application. But then I decided to focus on something slightly different. 
Instead of giving the typical talk about an XYZ method and how to apply it, I chose 
to provide a synthesis of my programming experience. More specifically, on my experience 
developing stats software from within my academia research career. 

Basically I'm sharing some personal thoughts around developing stats software at 
a **meta level framework**. I didn't talk about any technicalities or how to 
program. What I presented has to do with the general implications of my work. The 
take-home question is very simple: What it is that we achieve with a 
computational-analytical-tool? Personally, when I develop a package, I would like it to 
help me address at least one of the following principles:
