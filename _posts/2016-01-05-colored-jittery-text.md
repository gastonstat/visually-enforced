Using R to plot colored jittery text, just for fun.

### Introduction

Here's an Rtistic option using R to plot some text in an original way.

First things first: let's consider some text. For instance, part of the famous speech by Dr. King:

> I have a dream that my four little children
> will one day live in a nation,
> where they will not be judged by the color of their skin
> but by the content of their character.

Let's put the text in a character vector:

{% highlight r %}
speech <- c(
  "I have a dream that my four little children",
  "will one day live in a nation", 
  "where they will not be judged by the color of their skin",
  "but by the content of their character."
)
{% endhighlight %}

First we are going to plot the text as a single string, collapsing it with some new-line characters `"\n"`:

{% highlight r %}
plot(0, 0, type = 'n')
text(0, 0, paste(speech, collapse = '\n'))
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that we're using basic coordinates with a center for the plot on (0,0). This helps us identify reference points both in the x-axis and the y-axis for future manipulation of the character strings.

In order to plot each character with a different size and with different coordinates, we need to split the strings into individual characters. To do this we use the almighty function `strsplit()`. For testing purposes, let's take one sentence from MLK's `speech`. Also, we'll assign x-axis coordinates by dividing the range of the x-axis (form -1 to 1) in equal parts taking into account the number of characters in the input string:


{% highlight r %}
# one sentence for testing purposes
str <- "I have a dream that my four little children"

# splitting str in individual characters
txt <- unlist(strsplit(str, split = ''))

# x-coordinates for each character
nchars <- length(txt)
xs <- seq(-1, 1, length.out = nchars)

plot(0, 0, type = 'n')
for (i in 1:nchars) {
  text(xs[i], 0, labels = txt[i], cex = 1)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can add color and modify the size of the characters. In this case we'll use the `rainbow()` palette for colors, and the `runif()` function to generate uniform values to modify the sizes of the letters:


{% highlight r %}
# character expansion and colors
rcex <- runif(nchars, 1.5, 2)
cols <- rainbow(nchars, v = 0.8)

plot(0, 0, type = 'n')
for (i in 1:nchars) {
  text(xs[i], 0, labels = txt[i], cex = rcex, col = cols[i])
}
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, let's add some jitter to the y-position. We do this by adding some _noise_ following a normal distribution with mean zero and a small standard deviation via the `rnorm()` function:


{% highlight r %}
# jitter for y-coordinates
ry <- rnorm(nchars, 0, 0.03)

plot(0, 0, type = 'n')
for (i in 1:nchars) {
  text(xs[i], ry[i], labels = txt[i], cex = rcex, col = cols[i])
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Assembling the plot

Once we have all the necessary elements, we can add the rest of the speech lines, remove the axes, and add a little bit of color to the background. Moreover, to manipulate each line of text (i.e. each element in the `speech` vector) we break them down with `sapply()`, so we can loop over each line inside the plot:


{% highlight r %}
strs <- sapply(speech, function(x) strsplit(x, split=''))
ys <- seq(0.75, -0.75, length.out = length(strs))

# random seed
set.seed(34587)

# plot text
op <- par(mar = rep(0, 4), bg = 'gray97')
plot(0, 0, type = 'n', axes = FALSE)
for (elem in 1:length(strs)) {
  s <- unlist(strs[elem])
  ns <- length(s)
  xs <- seq(-1, 1, length.out = ns)
  rcex <- runif(ns, 1.5, 2)
  cols <- rainbow(ns, v = 0.8)
  ry <- rnorm(ns, 0, 0.03)
  
  for (i in 1:ns) {
    text(xs[i], ys[elem] + ry[i], labels = s[i], 
         cex = rcex[i], col = cols[i])
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight r %}
par(op)
{% endhighlight %}

### One more example


{% highlight r %}
speech <- c(
  "Here's to the crazy ones.",
  "The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.",
  "The round pegs in the square holes.", 
  "The ones who see things differently."
)

strs <- sapply(speech, function(x) strsplit(x, split=''))

ys <- seq(0.75, -0.75, length.out = length(strs))

set.seed(34587)
op <- par(mar = rep(0, 4), bg = 'gray15')
plot(0, 0, type = 'n', axes = FALSE)
for (elem in 1:length(strs)) {
  s <- unlist(strs[elem])
  ns <- length(s)
  xs <- seq(-1, 1, length.out = ns)
  rcex <- runif(ns, 1.5, 2)
  cols <- rainbow(ns, s = 1/elem, v = 0.8)
  ry <- rnorm(ns, 0, 0.03)
  
  for (i in 1:ns) {
    text(xs[i], ys[elem] + ry[i], labels = s[i], 
         cex = rcex[i], col = cols[i])
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
