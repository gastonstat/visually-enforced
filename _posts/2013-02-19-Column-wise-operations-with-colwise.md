In a [previous post]({% post_url 2012-06-08-Using-tapply-ddply-and-sqldf-for-the-same-task %}) 
I described different options in R to do some calculations using ```tapply()```, 
```ddply()```, and ```sqldf()```.

I used a simple example in which the goal was to apply 
a function by groups on some data. More specifically: how to calculate the average of a 
single variable taking into account a grouping variable (eg categorical variable).

This time I wanted to continue the discussion with another interesting task when 
operating on grouping variables. Say we have some categorical variable (like gender, 
geographic region, political affiliation) with other quantitative information. More 
often than not we want to calculate descriptive statistics taking into account the 
categorical variable. Maybe we want to calculate the average of all the quantitative 
variables by gender. How do you do that in R?

There are a number of different options to get the answer. One option is to use the 
function ```colwise()``` from the package ```"plyr"``` (by Hadley Wickham). The idea of 
```colwise()``` is to turn a function that operates on a vector into a function that 
operates column-wise on a ```data.frame```. The trick is to use ```colwise()``` inside 
the function ```ddply()```. Here's a simple example:

{% highlight r %}
# generate some fake data 
# (use 'set.seed' for replication purposes)
set.seed(80)
some_data = data.frame(matrix(rnorm(75), nrow=15, ncol=5))

# add categorical variable 'Group' (there will be 5 groups)
some_data$Group = as.factor(paste("Group", rep(1:5, each=3), sep="_"))

# load package plyr
require(plyr)

# ddply with colwise operation
group_means_data = ddply(some_data, .(Group), colwise(mean))

# get group means
group_means = as.matrix(group_means_data[,-1])
rownames(group_means) = group_means_data$Group

# inspect the results
group_means
{% endhighlight %}

You should get something like this:

{% highlight text %}
                 X1          X2         X3          X4         X5
Group_1  0.30145430  0.05948726 -0.4638955 -0.08925132  0.1919387
Group_2  0.10691675 -0.07851064 -0.1248169 -0.32776258  0.5754724
Group_3 -0.23172617 -0.10895998 -0.5388441  0.21742869  0.1327649
Group_4 -0.41673809  0.90000430 -0.5448786 -0.16260781  0.3347490
Group_5 -0.03758755  0.85385634 -0.4445546 -0.01103586 -0.5547903
{% endhighlight %}

We have the average values of all the variables for each group. Now let's visualize 
them to have a better idea of what's going on:

{% highlight r %}
# load 'ggplot2' and 'reshape'
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape)

# melt data
group_means_melt = melt(group_means_data)

# add auxiliar variable (for plotting purposes)
group_means_melt$aux = rep(1, nrow(group_means_melt))

# barplots for each group
ggplot(group_means_melt, aes(x = aux, y = value, fill = variable)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + 
  facet_wrap(~ Group) +
  xlab("") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank())
{% endhighlight %}
