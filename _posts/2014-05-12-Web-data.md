Much of the behind-the-scenes of my research work and side projects have to do 
with the so-called Web Technologies. Consequently, questions like *how to read/import data sets?*, 
or *how to preprocess data?* become more relevant with data coming from the Web. 

<!--more-->

How do I parse XML / HTML documents in R? How do I scrape those pieces of valuable information? 
How do I use R to interact with my browser and make the right requests? These are some of the 
frequently asked questions I've been constantly coming across with when trying to get data from the Web.

## Web Technologies for R

It's no secret or news that the Web is a vast source of data and information. 
The amount of content and its exponential growth surpasses our capacity to handle it analytically. 
We hardly know what to do with it, not to mention how to make sense of it. 
Most of us &mdash;statisticians, analysts, data scientists, data miners&mdash; are in the same 
quest for our holy grails: gaining insight and learning from data. That's where most 
of us are focusing our energies. However, in order to start crunching numbers, building 
models, and training machines to learn, we must first have access to the data itself. 

For those of us who primarily work with R, there are various packages that can help us 
get access to our precious data sources. In addition, there are various resources that 
can guide us on how to use the tools and functions in those packages.

[Deborah Nolan](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~nolan/) and 
[Duncan Temple Lang](http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~duncan/) have written an awesome book 
recently published at the beginning of this year.

[XML and Web Technologies for Data Sciences with R](http://www.springer.com/statistics/computational+statistics/book/978-1-4614-7899-7) 
is one of those books that I've been dreaming about for so long. It is THE compendium of reference 
for anyone interested in how to use R for interacting with Web Technologies.

(Parenthesis: I tip my hat to Duncan for all his amazing work, and his titanic effort 
leading the [omegahat project](http://www.omegahat.org/). Bravo!)

Before Deb and Duncan's book, the closest thing was Paul Murrell's excellent book 
[Introduction to Data Technologies](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/ItDT/) (ItDT).

You are probably more familiar with Paul's work around plots and data visualization with his famous 
book [R Graphics](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/RGraphics/rgraphics.html), but 
his **ItDT** ebook is one of those rare jewels that most of my closest colleagues 
have highly ignored. If you haven't taken a look at it before, stop reading this post and 
come back after you've checked Paul's ItDT.

Also recently this year, a new [Task View for Web Technologies](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/WebTechnologies.html) 
has been added to CRAN. This only reflects the trending topic status that those Web tools 
have in the R community. 


## Getting Data from the Web with R

I'm way behind the experience and expertise of Deb, Duncan, Paul and many other R leading 
figures. But still I want to contribute with my own take on how to use R for getting 
data from the Web. After some delays due to 
[my design hesitations](/blog/resources/2014/05/11/Making-of-GDWR.html), 
I've finished a set of [slides](/work/webdata) focused on: 
*How to get data from the Web with R*. 

<a href="/work/webdata">
<img class="centered" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/webdata_post.png">
</a>

In a nutshell, you'll find the following content:

1. Introduction
2. Reading files from the Web
3. Basics of XML
4. Parsing XML and HTML Documents
5. Handling JSON data
6. Basics of HTTP and RCurl
7. Getting Data via Web Forms
8. Getting Data via Web APIs


### PS

Inspired by some friends' inquiry, I thought this could also be a nice opportunity for me 
to talk about some of the [creative process](/blog/resources/2014/05/11/Making-of-GDWR.html)
I went through to design and prepare the material of these slides.
