I just came back from beautiful Lyon (France) after attending the 
<a href="http://r2013-lyon.sciencesconf.org/" target="_target">Deuxième Rencontres R</a> 
(2nd French R meeting, June 27-28). 

<!--more-->

The meeting was kindly organized by 
<a href="http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/members/dray/" target="_blank">Stéphane Dray</a> and 
<a href="http://r2013-lyon.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/4" target="_blank">company</a>, 
and hosted by l'Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1.

The main goal of this type of R meeting is to get together *la cRéme de la cRéme* in 
France working with R. Among some of the popular names you may have heard of: Romain 
François, Christophe Genolini, Karim Chine, Francois Husson, and Jérôme Sueur 
(just to name a few).


### Visualising big data in R (by Hadley Wickham)

<a href="http://had.co.nz/" target="_blank">Hadley Wickham</a>, now chief scientist 
at Rstudio, was the keynote speaker and he delighted us with his presentation on 
<a href="https://github.com/hadley/bigvis" target="_target">bigvis</a>. Briefly, the 
main idea behind the package bigvis is to provide exploratory visualization tools for 
very big large datasets (10-100 million observations).


### L'analyse des données avec FactoMineR (by François Husson)

<img class="centered" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2810/11464077156_75c6c6dd60.jpg" />

For those of us interested in data analysis tools, 
<a href="http://math.agrocampus-ouest.fr/infoglueDeliverLive/membres/Francois.Husson" target="_blank">François Husson</a> 
gave a presentation with some of the new improvements around the popular package 
<a href="http://factominer.free.fr/" target="_blank">FactoMineR</a> by the nice team 
at <a href="http://math.agrocampus-ouest.fr/infoglueDeliverLive/" target="_target">Applied Mathematic Department, Agrocampus Ouest</a> 
in Rennes.


### KmL3D: K-means pour données longitudinales jointes (by Christophe Genolini)

<img class="centered" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5546/11464002464_de90984561_o.jpg" />

Among other speakers, we had the chance to listen to 
<a href="http://christophe.genolini.free.fr/" target="_blank">Christophe Genolini</a> 
who showed us the package <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kml3d/index.html" target="_blank">KmL3D</a>. 
For the French community, if you are not familiar with Christophe, you should check 
his <a href="http://christophe.genolini.free.fr/webTutorial/index.php" target="_blank">tutorials</a> 
on creating R packages. Especially interesting for programming with S4 classes.


### Intégration R et C++ avec Rcpp (by Romain François)

<img class="centered" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2885/11464115053_aa0195c75e_o.jpg" />

Romain François, the guy behind <a href="http://gallery.r-enthusiasts.com/" target="_blank">R Graph Gallery</a>, 
gave a short presentation about the renowned package 
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html" target="_blank">Rcpp</a>. 
His slides were interesting, but what caught my attention was a the fact that he was 
using his smartphone to switch slides. Later I asked what he used and he told me it was 
the keynote app (which I think can be very useful!) Yes, you need wifi to synchronize 
your mac and your iphone but then you have the freedom to move around the stage.


### R and the Cloud (by Karim Chine)

Another very interesting talk was given by Karim Chine about 
<a href="http://www.elastic-r.net/" target="_blank">Elastic-R</a>. My main complain is 
that a one hour talk may not be enough to show all the really cool stuff you can do with 
R and cloud computing. It is my opinion but I think Karim deserves his own R meeting, 
or at least a couple of workshop sessions.


### R as a sound system (by Jérôme Sueur)

<img class="centered" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/seewave.png" />

Although I didn't take a picture of 
<a href="http://sueur.jerome.perso.neuf.fr/" target="_blank">Jérôme Sueur</a> 
(I was not close enough), his presentation was by far the best presentation of the 
entire meeting. He gave an illuminating talk on 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioacoustics" target="_blank">bioacoustics</a> 
and some of the packages that R offers to analyze sounds and acoustic data (see his R 
package <a href="http://rug.mnhn.fr/seewave/" target="_blank">seewave</a>).

I asked him if he was planning to share his slides. He told me that if the meeting 
organizers didn't share them, he would eventually upload the presentation to his website. 
In any case, I really hope he (or the meeting organizers) get to share the slides so you 
can check his awesome work. What I liked the most about his talk was the notion of 
*Sonification*, which is the analogy of visualization but instead of visual cues to 
represent data you use sounds to listen to data (ain't that cool?)
