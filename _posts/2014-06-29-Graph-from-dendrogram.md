R has various functions (and packages) for working with both hierarchical clustering 
dendrograms and graphs. The problem is that there's almost no information on how 
convert a dendrogram into a graph.

### Trees and Graphs

For one of my visualization projects I was faced with the following question: 
**How to obtain a graph structure from a dendrogram structure?** As simple as this 
question may seem, it took me a couple of days to find out a satisfactory answer.

Recall that a dendrogram is a just tree diagram used to display the arrangement of the 
clusters produced by hierarchical clustering. Interestingly, we can think of a 
dendrogram as a graph with a tree structure. The leafs of the 
dendrogram and the merged nodes can be seen as the graph nodes. In turn, the 
branches of the dendrogram can be regarded as the graph edges. 

<hr/>


### Hierarchical Clustering Dendrogram

Let's start by generating a hierarchical clustering with ```hclust()```. We'll 
use the data ```USArrests``` for demo purposes:

{% highlight r %}
# distance matrix 
dist_usarrests = dist(USArrests)

# hierarchical clustering analysis
clus_usarrests = hclust(dist_usarrests, method = "ward.D")

# plot dendrogram
plot(clus_usarrests, hang = -1)
{% endhighlight %}

Although ```"hclust"``` provides information about the merged nodes, it doesn't provide 
all the necessary elements to build a graph. To do this, we need to use 
the function ```as.phylo()``` from the R package ```"ape"```. The good news 
about a ```"phylo"``` object is that it contains all the tree edges needed 
to build a graph.

{% highlight r %}
# library ape
library(ape)

# convert 'hclust' to 'phylo' object
phylo_tree = as.phylo(clus_usarrests)

# get edges
graph_edges = phylo_tree$edge
{% endhighlight %}

<hr/>


### Graph

Once we have the edges we can build a graph using the function ```graph.edgelist()``` 
from the package ```"igraph"```.

{% highlight r %}
# library igraph
library(igraph)

# get graph from edge list
graph_net = graph.edgelist(graph_edges)

# plot graph
plot(graph_net)
{% endhighlight %}

The previous plot is kind of messy but the graph has exactly what we want: it has all the 
leafs, nodes and edges from the dendrogram.


Finally, we can play with the different graph layouts to get a set of x-y 
coordinates. For instance, we can use the ```layout.auto()``` function to get 
nodes nicely spread. Having the layout coordinates we can plot a graph with 
a tree structure using some R plotting tools:

{% highlight r %}
# extract layout (x-y coords)
graph_layout = layout.auto(graph_net)

# number of observations
nobs = nrow(USArrests)

# start plot
plot(graph_layout[,1], graph_layout[,2], type = "n", axes = FALSE,
     xlab = "", ylab = "")
# draw tree branches
segments(
  x0 = graph_layout[graph_edges[,1],1], 
  y0 = graph_layout[graph_edges[,1],2],
  x1 = graph_layout[graph_edges[,2],1],
  y1 = graph_layout[graph_edges[,2],2],
  col = "#dcdcdc55", lwd = 3.5
)
# add labels
text(graph_layout[1:nobs,1], graph_layout[1:nobs,2],
     phylo_tree$tip.label, cex = 1, xpd = TRUE, font = 1)
{% endhighlight %}
